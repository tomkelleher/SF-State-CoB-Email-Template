# SF-State-CoB-Email-Template
SF State CoB Email Template.

This is the basic email template used by the San Francisco State College of Business.

To use this template, you will need to use an email inliner. I reccomend the Zurb inliner. (http://foundation.zurb.com/emails/inliner-v2.html)

This template is based on the Zurb Foundation for Emails framework. (Formely Ink).
